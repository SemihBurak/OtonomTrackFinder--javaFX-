# OtonomTrackFinder

## Project Aim
OtonomTrackFinder is a JavaFX application designed to simulate the movement of various vehicles on a grid. The project aims to demonstrate pathfinding algorithms, specifically the A* algorithm, and their application in navigating a map with various obstacles.

## Features
- Multiple vehicle types including Tanks, Helicopters, Enemy Tanks, and Enemy Helicopters.
- Interactive grid where users can place vehicles and set their destinations.
- Visualization of the shortest path for each vehicle using the A* algorithm.
- Dynamic path recalculations in case of collisions or changes in the grid. Vehicles will change their path to avoid collisions.
- Different types of obstacles and towers that affect the vehicles' paths.

## Usage
1. **Start the Application**: Run the `Main` class to start the application.
2. **Choose Vehicle**: Select the type of vehicle to place on the grid.
3. **Set Start and Destination**: Click on the grid to set the start and destination points for the selected vehicle.
4. **Start Simulation**: Click the "Start" button to visualize the vehicles moving along the calculated paths.

## Controls
- **Add Tank**: Place a tank on the grid.
- **Add Helicopter**: Place a helicopter on the grid.
- **Add Enemy Tank**: Place an enemy tank on the grid.
- **Add Enemy Helicopter**: Place an enemy helicopter on the grid.
- **Reset**: Clear the grid and reset the simulation.
